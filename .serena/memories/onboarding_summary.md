I have completed the onboarding process for this project. I have created the following memory files:

- `project_purpose.md`: Describes the purpose of the project.
- `tech_stack.md`: Lists the technologies used in the project.
- `code_style.md`: Describes the code style and conventions.
- `suggested_commands.md`: Lists the most important commands for development.
- `codebase_structure.md`: Describes the structure of the codebase.

The next step is to start working on the actual tasks for this project.
