# Brainstorming Session Results: AI-Powered Trading Support System

**Session Date:** 2025-07-31
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Participant:** User

## 1. Executive Summary

**Topic:** Brainstorming a comprehensive AI-Powered Trading Support System.

**Session Goals:** Broad exploration of ideas ("as many ideas as possible") to define the features, architecture, and development roadmap for the system.

**Key Themes Identified:**
- **Personalization:** The AI must learn and adapt to the individual trader's style, methods, and risk tolerance.
- **Data-First Approach:** The core of the system is a high-quality, structured dataset of the user's own trading decisions, which will be used to train the AI models.
- **Phased Rollout:** The project will be developed in distinct phases, starting with a data collection platform (MVP) before introducing complex AI/LLM features and automation.
- **Visual & Interactive Journaling:** The primary user interaction for data input will be a visual, chart-based journaling system, not just text forms.

## 2. Core Product Modules (Feature Groups)

The brainstormed ideas were categorized into four main modules, which also represent the logical workflow of a trade:

### Module 1: Analysis & Signal Filtering
- **Purpose:** To identify potential trading opportunities.
- **Features:**
    - Automated technical analysis: Drawing trendlines, support/resistance zones.
    - Pattern recognition: Identifying candlestick and chart patterns.
    - Multi-timeframe analysis and confluence.
    - Indicator analysis: Strength measurement, divergence warnings.
    - Smart, personalized notifications for favorite setups.

### Module 2: Trade Suggestion & Execution
- **Purpose:** To turn an opportunity into a concrete trade plan.
- **Features:**
    - AI-driven analysis of signals based on the user's historical style.
    - Generation of complete trade suggestions (entry, SL, TP, position size).
    - Identification of highest-probability trade setups.
    - (Future) Automated trade execution.

### Module 3: Trade & Risk Management
- **Purpose:** To manage active trades and user psychology.
- **Features:**
    - Capital and position size calculation.
    - Optimal Risk/Reward ratio suggestions.
    - Smart Stop Loss (SL) and Take Profit (TP) recommendations.
    - Psychological alerts (e.g., warning after a losing streak).

### Module 4: Journaling & Performance Analytics
- **Purpose:** To create the foundational dataset and provide learning tools.
- **Features:**
    - Detailed, structured trade logging (bias, methodology, multi-TF analysis).
    - **Visual Journaling:** Attaching annotated chart snapshots to each trade log.
    - Performance statistics and identification of recurring mistakes.
    - Strategy simulation and back-testing.

## 3. Strategic Product Roadmap

A three-phase roadmap was established to ensure a sustainable and logical development path.

### Phase 1: MVP - The Smart Visual Journaling Platform
- **Goal:** Build the data foundation. Create a tool that provides immediate value to traders by helping them systematize their journaling.
- **Core Features:**
    - A dedicated page within the Next.js application.
    - An integrated open-source charting library.
    - **Visual Tools:** Allow users to draw **Trendlines** and **Rectangles (Zones)** on the chart.
    - **Structured Input:** Forms for users to manually input their analysis details (bias, methodology, etc.).
    - **Analysis Templates:** Allow users to create and reuse templates for their common analysis methods.
    - **Data Storage:** A robust backend (FastAPI) to save all structured data and chart snapshots.
- **NO LLM/AI in this phase.**

### Phase 2: The AI Analyst Assistant
- **Goal:** Introduce intelligence. Use the data from Phase 1 to provide actionable insights.
- **Core Features:**
    - Feed the user's historical data into LLM models.
    - The AI learns the user's style and starts generating its own analyses on new market data.
    - The system sends these AI-generated analyses and trade suggestions via smart notifications.
    - The user's role shifts from "data entry" to "reviewer/editor," correcting the AI's analysis to improve it further.

### Phase 3: Full Automation
- **Goal:** Maximize efficiency and performance.
- **Condition:** Only proceed when Phase 2 models have demonstrated consistent, positive performance.
- **Core Features:**
    - Allow the AI to execute and manage trades automatically based on the user-approved strategies and risk parameters.

## 4. Future Exploration & Ideas
- **Community Platform:** A future feature where users can share (anonymized) analyses and trade ideas to learn from each other.
- **Advanced Input Methods:** Exploring voice-to-text for notes or integration with broker platforms (like MT5) to auto-trigger draft journal entries.
