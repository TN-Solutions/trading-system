## Context

Retail traders currently face a major challenge: they have access to a vast amount of data but lack an effective process to consistently translate that information into performance improvement. Current journaling methods are often manual, cumbersome, and disconnected from trading outcomes, making it difficult to learn from mistakes or identify successful patterns.

This product addresses this problem by providing an AI-Personalized Trading Assistant. The core of the solution is a smart, visual-first journaling platform that allows traders to easily and systematically log their analyses and trading decisions. In the long term, this data will be used to train AI models to provide deeply personalized feedback and insights tailored to each user's unique trading style and psychology.
