# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience must be clean, professional, and efficient. The interface should prioritize clarity and speed, allowing traders to log their analysis with minimal friction. The focus is on a powerful tool, not an entertainment application. The interface must feel trustworthy and precise.

## Key Interaction Models
*   **Block-based Interactive Report:** Users will build their reports by adding, deleting, and arranging analysis "blocks." This is the core interaction model.
*   **Direct Chart Manipulation:** Users will interact directly with the chart to draw trendlines and zones, making the analysis process intuitive.
*   **Contextual Input:** Input fields for notes and structured data will be placed right next to the corresponding chart, maintaining context.
*   **Use of Modals:** CRUD actions for secondary items (like Assets, Methodologies) will use modals so users do not have to leave their main workspace.

## Core Screens and Views
*   **Login / Registration Page:** A simple interface for user authentication.
*   **Dashboard:** The main screen after login. It will display summary statistics and data visualizations. (The initial version can be simple).
*   **Analysis Report Management Page:** A dedicated page for managing (CRUD) analysis reports. This will be a main menu item.
*   **Asset Management Page:** A separate page allowing users to perform CRUD operations on their list of trading assets. This page will be a main menu item in the navigation.
*   **Methodology Management Page:** A separate page allowing users to perform CRUD operations on their list of trading methodologies. This will also be a main menu item.
*   **Analysis Report Editor:** The screen where users build and edit detailed reports.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
We will aim to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AA.

## Branding
The interface will adhere to the modern, minimalist aesthetic established by **Shadcn-ui** and Tailwind CSS.

## Target Devices and Platforms: Responsive Web (Desktop First)
The application will be built as a responsive web app, but the desktop experience will be prioritized and optimized.
