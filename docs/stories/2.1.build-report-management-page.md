## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3: Supabase Auth integration with RLS is complete and working. The authentication system is established. The project uses TypeScript strict mode, Next.js 14 App Router, and Shadcn-ui components. Testing infrastructure with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright is fully configured. The Asset and Methodology management features provide perfect patterns to follow for Report management implementation. Feature-based architecture with server actions pattern is working well.

### Data Models
The Report model is defined with the following structure:
- `id`: uuid (Primary key)
- `user_id`: uuid (Foreign key to auth.users)
- `asset_id`: uuid (Foreign key to assets table)
- `methodology_id`: uuid (Foreign key to methodologies table)
- `title`: text (Title of the report)
- `status`: text (Status: 'draft' or 'published')
- `created_at`: timestamp (Creation timestamp)
- `updated_at`: timestamp (Last update timestamp)
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#43-model-report]

### API Specifications
- Data operations use Supabase client library through Next.js Server Actions
- No traditional REST API - operations go through PostgreSQL with RLS
- Server Actions pattern: React component → Server Action → Supabase client → PostgreSQL
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own reports: `(auth.uid() = user_id)`
- Report queries need proper joins to include asset and methodology details for display
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#example-query-flow and architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#113-authentication-and-authorization-architecture]

### Component Specifications
- Use Shadcn-ui components for consistent UI patterns
- Data table should follow established patterns with sorting, filtering, pagination
- Follow feature-based architecture with components in `features/reports/`
- Page views should be placed in `features/reports/page-views/`
- Server actions should be in `features/reports/actions/`
- Follow existing Asset and Methodology management patterns for consistency
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#101-routing-and-component-architecture and architecture/6-components.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Route page: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`
- Feature components: `frontend/src/features/reports/components/`
- Page view: `frontend/src/features/reports/page-views/report-management-view.tsx`
- Server actions: `frontend/src/features/reports/actions/`
- Data table: `frontend/src/features/reports/components/report-data-table.tsx`
- Create button: `frontend/src/features/reports/components/create-report-button.tsx`
- Report service: `frontend/src/features/reports/services/report-service.ts`
[Source: architecture/12-source-tree.md and architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]

### Testing Requirements
Follow the established testing pyramid:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library for report components
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete CRUD flows with MSW for API mocking
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical report management workflows
- **Test Coverage**: High coverage required for business logic components
- **Test Locations**: 
  - Unit: `frontend/src/features/reports/components/__tests__/`
  - Integration: `frontend/src/features/reports/__tests__/`
  - E2E: `frontend/tests/e2e/reports/`
[Source: architecture/15-coding-standards.md#153-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript 5.x with strict mode and full type safety
- Next.js 14.x App Router architecture
- Supabase integration with Row Level Security
- Input validation on both client and server sides
- Follow established naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions, snake_case for DB
- No business logic in components - use service/action layer
- Proper error handling and loading states required
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md and architecture/15-coding-standards.md#154-coding-standards]

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.reports (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    asset_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.assets(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    methodology_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.methodologies(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft', -- 'draft' or 'published'
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
ALTER TABLE public.reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths and component locations align with the established project structure. The reports feature follows the same pattern as existing assets and methodologies features, ensuring consistency across the application.

## Testing

**Test Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E tests

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `frontend/src/features/reports/components/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `frontend/src/features/reports/__tests__/`
- E2E tests: `frontend/tests/e2e/reports/`

**Testing Standards:**
- High code coverage for report management business logic
- Mock Supabase calls using MSW for integration tests
- Test error states and edge cases
- E2E tests must cover complete report CRUD workflows

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test form validation with invalid inputs (empty title, invalid asset/methodology selections)
- Test successful and failed CRUD operations
- Test data table pagination, sorting, and filtering
- Test RLS enforcement (users can only see their own reports)
- Test proper error handling and user feedback
- Test create new report button functionality

  - **Why**: Eliminates lint warnings and ensures test maintainability
  - **How**: Improves code cleanliness by removing dead imports and fixing variable naming consistency

- **File**: `frontend/src/features/reports/components/__tests__/report-table.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Removed unused `fireEvent` and `userEvent` imports
  - **Why**: Reduces bundle size and eliminates lint warnings
  - **How**: Keeps only necessary testing utilities imported

- **File**: `frontend/src/features/reports/page-views/report-management-view.tsx`
  - **Change**: Removed unused `handleCloseForm` function
  - **Why**: Eliminates dead code and lint warnings
  - **How**: Removes functionality that was declared but never called

- **File**: `frontend/src/features/reports/services/report-service.ts`

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent** - Follows PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions, snake_case for DB. TypeScript strict mode with proper type safety.
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Perfect** - Feature-based architecture matches established patterns. All files in correct locations per unified project structure.
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠ **Good with Issues** - Comprehensive test coverage but ESM module compatibility issues with `nuqs` package prevent some tests from running. Integration and E2E tests properly structured.
