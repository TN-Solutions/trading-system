## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: Supabase Auth integration is complete and working. The authentication system with RLS is established. The project uses TypeScript strict mode, Next.js 14 App Router, and Shadcn-ui components. Testing infrastructure with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright is fully configured.

### Data Models
The Asset model is defined with the following structure:
- `id`: uuid (Primary key)
- `user_id`: uuid (Foreign key to auth.users)
- `symbol`: text (Unique trading symbol per user, e.g., "EURUSD")
- `name`: text (Full name of the asset, e.g., "Euro / US Dollar")
- `description`: text (Optional description)
- `created_at`: timestamp (Creation timestamp)
- Constraint: `(user_id, symbol)` must be unique per user
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#41-model-asset]

### API Specifications
- Data operations use Supabase client library through Next.js Server Actions
- No traditional REST API - operations go through PostgreSQL with RLS
- Server Actions pattern: React component → Server Action → Supabase client → PostgreSQL
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own assets: `(auth.uid() = user_id)`
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#example-query-flow and architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#113-authentication-and-authorization-architecture]

### Component Specifications
- Use Shadcn-ui components for consistent UI patterns
- Data table should follow established patterns with sorting, filtering, pagination
- Forms should use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Follow feature-based architecture with components in `features/assets/`
- Page views should be placed in `features/assets/page-views/`
- Server actions should be in `features/assets/actions/`
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#101-routing-and-component-architecture and architecture/6-components.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Route page: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/assets/page.tsx`
- Feature components: `frontend/src/features/assets/components/`
- Page view: `frontend/src/features/assets/page-views/asset-management-view.tsx`
- Server actions: `frontend/src/features/assets/actions/`
- Data table: `frontend/src/features/assets/components/asset-data-table.tsx`
- Forms: `frontend/src/features/assets/components/asset-form.tsx`
- Asset service: `frontend/src/features/assets/services/asset-service.ts`
[Source: architecture/12-source-tree.md and architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]

### Testing Requirements
Follow the established testing pyramid:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library for asset components
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete CRUD flows with MSW for API mocking
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical asset management workflows
- **Test Coverage**: High coverage required for business logic components
- **Test Locations**: 
  - Unit: `frontend/src/features/assets/components/__tests__/`
  - Integration: `frontend/src/features/assets/__tests__/`
  - E2E: `frontend/tests/e2e/assets/`
[Source: architecture/15-coding-standards.md#153-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript 5.x with strict mode and full type safety
- Next.js 14.x App Router architecture
- Supabase integration with Row Level Security
- Input validation on both client and server sides
- Follow established naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions, snake_case for DB
- No business logic in components - use service/action layer
- Proper error handling and loading states required
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md and architecture/15-coding-standards.md#154-coding-standards]

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.assets (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE(user_id, symbol)
);
ALTER TABLE public.assets ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md]

### Testing
**Test Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E tests

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `frontend/src/features/assets/components/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `frontend/src/features/assets/__tests__/`
- E2E tests: `frontend/tests/e2e/assets/`

**Testing Standards:**
- High code coverage for asset management business logic
- Mock Supabase calls using MSW for integration tests
- Test error states and edge cases
- E2E tests must cover complete asset CRUD workflows

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test form validation with invalid inputs (duplicate symbols, empty required fields)
- Test successful and failed CRUD operations
- Test data table pagination, sorting, and filtering
- Test RLS enforcement (users can only see their own assets)
- Test proper error handling and user feedback
