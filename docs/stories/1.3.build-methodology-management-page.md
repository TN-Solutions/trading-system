## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: Supabase Auth integration is complete and working. The authentication system with RLS is established. The project uses TypeScript strict mode, Next.js 14 App Router, and Shadcn-ui components. Testing infrastructure with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright is fully configured. The Asset management feature provides a perfect pattern to follow for Methodology management implementation.

### Data Models
The Methodology model is defined with the following structure:
- `id`: uuid (Primary key)
- `user_id`: uuid (Foreign key to auth.users)
- `name`: text (Name of the methodology, e.g., "ICT")
- `description`: text (Optional description)
- `created_at`: timestamp (Creation timestamp)
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#42-model-methodology]

### API Specifications
- Data operations use Supabase client library through Next.js Server Actions
- No traditional REST API - operations go through PostgreSQL with RLS
- Server Actions pattern: React component → Server Action → Supabase client → PostgreSQL
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own methodologies: `(auth.uid() = user_id)`
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#example-query-flow and architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#113-authentication-and-authorization-architecture]

### Component Specifications
- Use Shadcn-ui components for consistent UI patterns
- Data table should follow established patterns with sorting, filtering, pagination
- Forms should use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Follow feature-based architecture with components in `features/methodologies/`
- Page views should be placed in `features/methodologies/page-views/`
- Server actions should be in `features/methodologies/actions/`
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#101-routing-and-component-architecture and architecture/6-components.md]

### File Locations

- Methodology service: `frontend/src/features/methodologies/services/methodology-service.ts`
[Source: architecture/12-source-tree.md and architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]

### Testing Requirements
Follow the established testing pyramid:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library for methodology components
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete CRUD flows with MSW for API mocking
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical methodology management workflows
- **Test Coverage**: High coverage required for business logic components
- **Test Locations**: 
  - Unit: `frontend/src/features/methodologies/components/__tests__/`
  - Integration: `frontend/src/features/methodologies/__tests__/`
  - E2E: `frontend/tests/e2e/methodologies/`
[Source: architecture/15-coding-standards.md#153-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript 5.x with strict mode and full type safety
- Next.js 14.x App Router architecture
- Supabase integration with Row Level Security
- Input validation on both client and server sides
- Follow established naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions, snake_case for DB
- No business logic in components - use service/action layer
- Proper error handling and loading states required
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md and architecture/15-coding-standards.md#154-coding-standards]

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.methodologies (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
ALTER TABLE public.methodologies ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall assessment**: The implementation demonstrates solid software engineering practices with comprehensive CRUD functionality, proper type safety, and good separation of concerns. The code follows established patterns from the asset management feature and implements all acceptance criteria correctly. The database schema includes proper RLS policies and the unique constraint for user-scoped methodology names.

**Architecture**: Well-structured feature-based architecture with clear separation between components, actions, services, and page views. Server actions properly enforce authentication and RLS policies.

**TypeScript Implementation**: Excellent type safety with proper Zod validation schemas and consistent type definitions throughout the codebase.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `frontend/src/features/methodologies/services/methodology-service.ts`
  - **Change**: Deprecated the client-side service class and prevented instantiation
  - **Why**: The original service used client-side Supabase queries which bypass RLS policies and create security vulnerabilities
  - **How**: Replaced implementation with deprecation warnings directing developers to use secure server actions instead

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to TypeScript strict mode, consistent naming conventions (PascalCase components, camelCase functions, snake_case DB), proper error handling
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect alignment with feature-based architecture, correct file locations matching established patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test suite with unit tests, integration tests, and good coverage of edge cases and validation scenarios
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Deprecated insecure client-side service (methodology-service.ts)
- [x] Verified proper RLS enforcement through server actions
- [x] Confirmed comprehensive form validation with Zod schemas
- [x] Validated error handling patterns match project standards
- [x] Reviewed test coverage - excellent unit and integration test suite

### Security Review

**✓ Secure Implementation**
- All database operations use server actions with proper authentication checks
- RLS policies correctly enforce user-scoped access (users can only manage their own methodologies)
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate methodology names per user
- Input validation on both client and server sides
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data exposure
- Proper error message handling without information leakage

**Security Best Practices Applied:**
- Server-side authentication verification in all CRUD operations
- Database-level security through RLS policies
- Client-side service deprecated to prevent RLS bypass
- Proper error handling with generic messages for security failures

### Performance Considerations

**✓ Well Optimized**
- Efficient database queries with proper ordering and filtering
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Proper loading states and error boundaries
- Data table with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities
- Minimal re-renders through proper state management

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

The methodology management implementation is production-ready with excellent code quality, comprehensive testing, and proper security measures. All acceptance criteria are met, the code follows established patterns, and the security vulnerability in the original service class has been addressed. The feature provides a complete CRUD interface for methodology management with proper user authentication and data isolation.
