## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1: Supabase Auth integration with RLS is complete and working. The authentication system is established. The project uses TypeScript strict mode, Next.js 14 App Router, and Shadcn-ui components. Testing infrastructure with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright is fully configured. The Report management feature provides the foundation with CRUD operations working well. Feature-based architecture with server actions pattern is established and working. The reports feature structure is already in place at `frontend/src/features/reports/`.

### Data Models
The AnalysisBlock model is defined with the following structure:
- `id`: uuid (Primary key)
- `report_id`: uuid (Foreign key to reports table)
- `user_id`: uuid (Foreign key to auth.users for RLS simplification)
- `timeframe`: text (Chart timeframe e.g., 'H4', 'D1')
- `is_primary`: boolean (Marks if this is the primary analysis timeframe)
- `bias`: text (Bias of the analysis: 'bullish', 'bearish', 'neutral')
- `chart_data`: jsonb (Data for chart drawings)
- `notes`: text (User's text notes)
- `snapshot_image_url`: text (Optional URL to a screenshot of the analysis)
- `created_at`: timestamp (Creation timestamp)
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#44-model-analysisblock]

The Report model structure includes:
- `id`: uuid (Primary key)
- `user_id`: uuid (Foreign key to auth.users)
- `asset_id`: uuid (Foreign key to assets table)
- `methodology_id`: uuid (Foreign key to methodologies table)
- `title`: text (Title of the report)
- `status`: text (Status: 'draft' or 'published')
- `created_at`: timestamp (Creation timestamp)
- `updated_at`: timestamp (Last update timestamp)
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#43-model-report]

### API Specifications
- Data operations use Supabase client library through Next.js Server Actions
- No traditional REST API - operations go through PostgreSQL with RLS
- Server Actions pattern: React component → Server Action → Supabase client → PostgreSQL
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own analysis blocks: `(auth.uid() = user_id)`
- Analysis block queries need proper joins to include report details when needed
- Report updates need to handle title, asset_id, methodology_id changes
[Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#113-authentication-and-authorization-architecture]

### Component Specifications
Report Editor component should manage complex state including:
- Current report data and analysis blocks array
- Form state for report title, asset, methodology selection
- Block editing state (add/delete operations)
- Save/auto-save functionality

Use Shadcn-ui components for consistent UI patterns:
- Form components for title and dropdowns
- Button components for add/delete/save actions
- Card components for analysis blocks
- Dialog components for confirmations

Follow feature-based architecture with components in `features/reports/`:
- Page views should be placed in `features/reports/page-views/`
- Server actions should be in `features/reports/actions/`
- Editor components in `features/reports/components/`
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#101-routing-and-component-architecture and architecture/6-components.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Route page: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/reports/[reportId]/page.tsx`
- Editor view: `frontend/src/features/reports/page-views/report-editor-view.tsx`
- Main editor: `frontend/src/features/reports/components/report-editor.tsx`
- Analysis block component: `frontend/src/features/reports/components/analysis-block.tsx`
- Server actions: `frontend/src/features/reports/actions/analysis-block-actions.ts`
- Updated report actions: `frontend/src/features/reports/actions/report-actions.ts`
- Block service: `frontend/src/features/reports/services/analysis-block-service.ts`
[Source: architecture/12-source-tree.md and architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]

### Testing Requirements
Follow the established testing pyramid:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library for editor components
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete block CRUD flows with MSW for API mocking
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical report editing workflows
- **Test Coverage**: High coverage required for business logic components
- **Test Locations**: 
  - Unit: `frontend/src/features/reports/components/__tests__/`
  - Integration: `frontend/src/features/reports/__tests__/`
  - E2E: `frontend/tests/e2e/reports/`
[Source: architecture/15-coding-standards.md#153-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript 5.x with strict mode and full type safety
- Next.js 14.x App Router architecture
- Supabase integration with Row Level Security
- Input validation on both client and server sides
- Follow established naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions, snake_case for DB
- No business logic in components - use service/action layer
- Proper error handling and loading states required
- State management with Zustand for complex editor state
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md and architecture/15-coding-standards.md#154-coding-standards]

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.analysis_blocks (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    report_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.reports(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    timeframe TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_primary BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    bias TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'bullish', 'bearish', 'neutral'
    chart_data JSONB,
    notes TEXT,
    snapshot_image_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
ALTER TABLE public.analysis_blocks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md]

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths and component locations align with the established project structure. The report editor follows the same feature-based pattern as existing reports management, ensuring consistency across the application. The dynamic route `/reports/[reportId]` follows Next.js App Router conventions.

## Testing

**Test Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E tests

**Test File Locations:**

## QA Results
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
**Status:** <span style="color:red;">**REJECTED**</span>

### Summary
The core implementation of the interactive report editor is well-executed. The code adheres to the established architecture, follows security best practices with RLS, and provides a good user experience foundation. However, the story is critically incomplete due to a near-total lack of testing for the new functionality. The existing tests relate to the previous report management feature and do not cover the new interactive editor components or logic.

### Positive Findings
*   **Code Quality:** The TypeScript code is clean, strongly-typed, and follows project conventions.
*   **Architecture:** The feature is correctly integrated into the existing feature-based architecture, using server actions and client components appropriately.
*   **Security:** Server actions correctly validate user ownership, and RLS policies are properly checked before any data mutation.
*   **Functionality:** Manual testing of the UI flow shows the core features (adding/editing/deleting blocks, saving the report) are functional.

### Critical Issues
1.  **Missing Unit Tests:** No unit tests were found for the new components.
    *   **Required:** `frontend/src/features/reports/components/__tests__/report-editor.test.tsx`
    *   **Required:** `frontend/src/features/reports/components/__tests__/analysis-block.test.tsx`
2.  **Missing Integration Tests:** There are no integration tests for the `analysis-block-actions`.
    *   **Required:** `frontend/src/features/reports/__tests__/analysis-block-integration.test.tsx` to test the full CRUD flow for analysis blocks, mocking the Supabase client.
3.  **Missing E2E Tests:** The Playwright test suite does not include tests for the new report editor workflow.
    *   **Required:** `frontend/tests/e2e/reports/report-editor.spec.ts` to cover the user journey of opening, editing, adding a block, and saving a report.

### Minor Recommendations
*   **Use Custom Dialog:** Replace the native `window.confirm()` in `AnalysisBlockComponent` with the project's `AlertDialog` (from Shadcn-ui) for consistent UX.
*   **Image Error Handling:** In `AnalysisBlockComponent`, instead of using `onError` to imperatively hide the image, it would be more idiomatic to use a state variable to track the loading error and conditionally render the fallback UI.

### Action Required
The story's status should be moved back to **In Progress**. The development team must implement the required tests outlined above. The story cannot be considered "Done" until it meets the project's testing standards.
