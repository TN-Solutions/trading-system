## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 2.5.1-2.5.4 established the complete FastAPI market data service with ingestion endpoint (POST /api/v1/candles), query endpoint (GET /api/v1/candles), and MT5 Expert Advisor integration. The service is currently configured for local development with Docker. This story transitions the service to production deployment on Vercel Functions with proper security controls for frontend integration.

### Data Models
The deployed service must maintain compatibility with established API contracts:
- **Ingestion Endpoint**: POST /api/v1/candles with X-API-KEY authentication for MT5 EA
- **Query Endpoint**: GET /api/v1/candles with internal authentication for Next.js frontend
- **Database Schema**: market_data_candles table with established RLS policies
- **Response Formats**: Maintain JSON schemas for klinecharts compatibility
- **Environment Variables**: API keys, database URLs, CORS origins configuration

### API Specifications
Production deployment requirements for API endpoints:
- **Public URL**: Deployed on Vercel Functions with HTTPS endpoints
- **Authentication**: X-API-KEY for ingestion, internal token for query endpoint
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to frontend application domain only
- **Rate Limiting**: Production-appropriate rate limits for API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Health Monitoring**: /health endpoint for uptime monitoring and health checks

### Component Specifications
Vercel Functions deployment architecture:
- **Platform**: Vercel Functions as specified in tech stack for serverless deployment
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11+ runtime compatible with Vercel Functions
- **Framework**: FastAPI with async capabilities optimized for serverless execution
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL connection using service_role credentials
- **Security**: Domain-based access control and network security policies
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics and Sentry integration for error tracking
- **Logging**: Vercel Logs for request/response logging and debugging
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#build-tool]

### File Locations
Production deployment configuration files:
- **Vercel Configuration**: `backend/vercel.json` for API routing and function settings
- **Environment Config**: Production environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- **Main API Handler**: `backend/src/app/main.py` adapted for Vercel Functions
- **Health Endpoint**: `backend/src/app/api/routes/health.py` for monitoring
- **CORS Middleware**: `backend/src/app/core/security.py` for domain restrictions
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` for automated deployment

- **Performance**: Optimized API responses for chart data rendering
- **Caching**: Consider caching strategies for frequently requested market data
- **Monitoring**: Request logging and performance tracking for frontend integration

### Deployment Architecture Notes
This deployment completes the full market data system architecture with production-grade security and reliability. The FastAPI service becomes a secure, scalable microservice that bridges MT5 data ingestion with Next.js frontend consumption, following the established hybrid backend architecture pattern.
