## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models
No specific data models are affected by this story. Supabase Auth manages the `auth.users` table automatically.
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md - references to auth.users(id)]

### API Specifications
- Authentication will use Supabase Auth API endpoints automatically
- No custom API endpoints required for basic auth flows
- Future data operations will reference `auth.uid()` for user identification
[Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#113-authentication-and-authorization-architecture]

### Component Specifications
- Sign-in/Sign-up forms should use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Authentication components should follow established UI patterns with Shadcn-ui
- Error states and loading states must be properly handled
[Source: architecture/15-security-performance-and-standards.md#151-security-requirements]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Authentication pages: `frontend/src/app/auth/sign-in/` and `frontend/src/app/auth/sign-up/`
- Middleware: `frontend/src/middleware.ts`
- Supabase client config: `frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts` (to be created)
- Authentication components: `frontend/src/components/auth/` (to be created)
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for authentication components using Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration tests for auth flows using MSW for API mocking
- E2E tests for critical authentication workflows using Playwright
- Test coverage requirement for business logic components
[Source: architecture/15-security-performance-and-standards.md#153-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript 5.x must be used with full type safety
- Next.js 14.x App Router architecture
- Supabase Auth integration with Row Level Security (RLS) preparation
- Environment variables must be properly configured and secured
- Input validation on both client and server sides required
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md and architecture/15-security-performance-and-standards.md#151-security-requirements]

### Testing
**Test Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E tests

**Test File Locations:** 
- Unit tests: `frontend/src/components/auth/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `frontend/src/features/auth/__tests__/`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/auth/`

**Testing Standards:**
- High code coverage for authentication business logic
- Mock external Supabase calls using MSW
- Test error states and edge cases
- E2E tests must cover complete user registration and login flows

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test form validation with invalid inputs
- Test successful and failed authentication attempts  
- Test middleware redirect behavior
- Test session persistence across page refreshes

- **Impact**: Developer onboarding confusion

#### 📋 Updated Action Items

**SHOULD FIX (Next Sprint)**
1. **Update Documentation**
   - Replace Clerk references in README.md
   - Add Supabase setup instructions

2. **Add Error Boundary Components**
   - Wrap auth forms in error boundaries
   - Improve user experience for auth failures

3. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Add runtime validation for required Supabase env vars
   - Fail fast with clear error messages

#### ✅ Security Assessment

**Authentication Security: STRONG**
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- ✅ Proper server-side session validation
- ✅ CSRF protection via Supabase's built-in mechanisms
- ✅ Secure cookie handling in middleware
- ✅ Input validation on client and server

**Compliance**: Meets security requirements from architecture/15-security-performance-and-standards.md

#### 🎯 Recommendations for Future

1. **Monitoring**: Add auth event logging for security monitoring

**Blocker Issues**: 0  
**Quality Score**: 9.5/10  

All critical requirements have been met including comprehensive testing implementation. The authentication migration from Clerk to Supabase is now fully complete with proper test coverage.
