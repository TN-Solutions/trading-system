# 8. Responsiveness Strategy

*   **Approach:** The design will follow a **desktop-first** strategy, optimizing for large screens and then gracefully adapting to smaller screens like tablets and mobile phones.

## Breakpoints

*   We will use the default Tailwind CSS breakpoints:
    *   `sm`: 640px
    *   `md`: 768px
    *   `lg`: 1024px
    *   `xl`: 1280px

## Adaptation Patterns

*   **Layout Changes:**
    *   On smaller screens (`< 1024px`), multi-column layouts (e.g., on the Dashboard) will switch to a single column.
    *   Components will use `flex-wrap` to automatically wrap when there is not enough space.

*   **Navigation Changes:**
    *   On smaller screens (`< 1024px`), the main left sidebar will be hidden by default and can be toggled via a "hamburger" button in the header.

*   **Data Table Adaptation:**
    *   On narrow screens, Data Tables will allow horizontal scrolling to view all columns. The most important columns will be kept visible on the left.

*   **Interaction Changes:**
    *   The size of touch targets like buttons and links will be ensured to be large enough for easy use on touch devices.
