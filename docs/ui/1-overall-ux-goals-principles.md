# 1. Overall UX Goals & Principles

## Target User Personas

*   **The Serious Learner:** Traders with less than 2 years of experience, actively seeking a consistent methodology. They need a structured framework for analysis, logging, and a way to control emotions and build confidence.
*   **The Part-time Pro:** Profitable but inconsistent traders who trade alongside a primary job. They need time-saving automation tools to help them find and fix small, performance-impacting leaks in their strategy.

## Usability Goals

*   **Efficiency of Use:** Allow traders to log their analysis with minimal friction, helping them quickly return to observing the market.
*   **Ease of Learning:** New users can complete the core journaling process in less than 5 minutes without detailed instructions.
*   **Habit Formation:** The interface must be engaging and valuable enough to encourage users to create at least 3 reports per week.
*   **Trust and Reliability:** Users must trust that their data is safe, secure, and that analyses are presented accurately.

## Design Principles

1.  **Clarity over Cleverness:** Prioritize clear communication and easy-to-understand data presentation over complex aesthetic design elements. The interface must be professional and focused.
2.  **Efficiency is Key:** Every interaction must be purposeful and optimized for speed. Minimize clicks and unnecessary steps.
3.  **Data-driven Confidence:** The design must highlight data and insights, helping users make informed decisions and feel in control.
4.  **Progressive Disclosure:** Only show what is necessary at the right time. Avoid overwhelming users by hiding advanced features or information until they are requested.
