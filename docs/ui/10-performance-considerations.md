*   **Page Load:** Optimize images and use Next.js features like dynamic imports to reduce initial load time.
*   **Interaction Response:** Ensure user interactions have immediate feedback (<100ms). Use loading states for asynchronous operations.
*   **Design Strategies:** Avoid using large images, videos, or complex animations that could slow down performance.
