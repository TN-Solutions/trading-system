# 9. Animation & Micro-interactions

*   **Motion Principles:** Motion should be used purposefully to provide feedback and guide the user, not for decoration. Animations should be fast, subtle, and non-intrusive.
*   **Key Animations:**
    *   **State Changes:** Use a light fade effect when elements appear or disappear.
    *   **Button Clicks:** Provide a subtle press effect to confirm interaction.
    *   **Modal/Dialog:** The dialog will appear with a slight zoom and fade effect.
