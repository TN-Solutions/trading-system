**Session Date:** 2025-07-31
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Participant:** User

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive market analysis for the "AI-Powered Trading Support System," with a specific focus on its Minimum Viable Product (MVP): a Smart Visual Journaling Platform. The research indicates a significant and growing market for online trading tools, projected to reach over $12 billion globally in 2025.

Our key opportunity lies in a specific market gap: **deep AI personalization**. While existing competitors offer robust analytics or basic AI, none are focused on creating an AI that learns and adapts to a user's unique trading style. Our target audience consists of "Serious Learners" and "Part-time Pros" who are actively seeking ways to systematize and optimize their trading strategies.

The competitive landscape includes established players like **Tradervue** (strong in analytics) and innovators like **TraderSync** (strong in UI/AI). Our strategy is not to compete on the breadth of statistical metrics but to win on the depth of personalization and a superior, visual-first journaling experience. The initial addressable market (SOM) for this niche is estimated at **$6-18 million** annually, representing a significant early-stage opportunity.

The primary recommendation is to proceed with the development of the MVP, focusing on delivering a seamless visual journaling experience to build a foundational user base and a rich, proprietary dataset for future AI development.
